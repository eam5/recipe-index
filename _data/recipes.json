Lemongrass, galangal, turmeric, kapi (Thai shrimp paste), and lime leaves can be found at well-stocked supermarkets or an Asian market that carries Thai ingredients; they freeze well. You can substitute 1\u00bd teaspoons of dried turmeric for the fresh turmeric. Prepare the other curry paste ingredients while the arbols hydrate. To avoid inhaling spicy fumes while stir-frying, use an exhaust fan or open a window. This dish is meant to be intensely spicy and should be eaten with rice in a ratio of 1 part pork to 2 parts rice. The sliced chiles enable diners to customize the spice level, but they can be omitted if desired. To make a half batch of khua kling, make a full recipe of curry paste and freeze half of it; cut all the other ingredients in half. Chilled cucumber slices make a complementary, cooling accompaniment.\n"

Add curry paste and cook, stirring constantly with wok spatula or wooden spoon, until paste just begins to stick, about 2 minutes. Add pork and mash and chop until meat and paste are mostly combined. Increase heat to medium-high and continue to cook, stirring and chopping constantly, until pork breaks into small pieces and is mostly cooked but some pink bits remain, about 3 minutes (if mixture starts to stick, deglaze with reserved arbol liquid, using 1 tablespoon at a time).\n",

If it's unavailable, substitute Robiola or a mixture of 8 ounces cream cheese and 4 ounces (1 cup) shredded fontina (use a young Italian cheese) processed in a food processor until combined. Using high-protein King Arthur Bread Flour makes the dough easier to stretch, but other bread flours will work. For the best results, weigh your flour. If your oven does not go to 525 degrees, set it to the highest possible temperature and extend the baking time slightly. Minimize the time between assembling and baking the focaccia to prevent it from sticking to the pan. Serve as a snack with cocktails or as an appetizer.

Almond meal will result in a darker, slightly coarser filling. Vanilla or almond extract can be substituted for the rum. Traditionally a f\u00e8ve (a dried bean but often an almond or trinket) is hidden in the cake; the person who finds it is crowned the king or queen for the day.\n"

        "instructions": [
            "FOR THE GALETTE: Combine almond flour, sugar, flour, and salt in large bowl. Add butter; toss to coat. Rub butter pieces into almond mixture with your fingertips until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in eggs and rum to combine. Set aside.\n",
            "Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. On lightly floured counter, roll 1 sheet pastry into 10-inch square. Fold in half, place on 1 prepared pan and refrigerate. Roll second sheet pastry into 10-inch square. Using bowl as template, lightly trace 9\u00bd-inch round with paring knife (do not cut through pastry) and place on second prepared pan.\n",
            "Transfer filling to center of traced circle. Refrigerate until filling is chilled, about 20 minutes. Using offset spatula, spread filling into 7\u00bd-inch round, leaving 1-inch border between filling and edge of traced circle. Press bean, if using, into top of filling. Brush border with egg wash.\n",
            "Without unfolding, gently place second pastry sheet on top half of filling, making sure edges of dough sheets are aligned. Unfold pastry to cover filling. Using sides of your hands, mold pastry tightly around filling, pressing down around edges to release any air pockets. Using sharp knife and bowl that served as template, cut out round. Discard trimming or save for other use. Press down gently to seal edges and freeze galette until firm, about 30 minutes. While galette chills, adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 375 degrees.\n",
            "Brush galette with egg wash. Using toothpick, make 9 evenly spaced holes in dough over filling (eight around perimeter and one in center). To create design, starting at center of galette, drag toothpick in curved line to edge of filling mound. Turn baking sheet slightly and repeat, spacing lines about \u00bc inch apart, until surface is covered.\n",
            "Bake on lower rack until galette is lightly browned around edges but still pale on top, about 20 minutes. Move galette to upper rack and bake until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.\n",
            "FOR THE GLAZE: Meanwhile, combine sugar, water, and corn syrup in small bowl. Microwave until sugar is dissolved, 45 to 60 seconds, stirring every 15 seconds.\n",
            "Remove galette from oven; turn off oven. Brush top of galette with glaze and return to upper rack until surface is shiny and dry, about 10 minutes. Transfer baking sheet to wire rack and cool for at least 30 minutes. Using serrated knife in gentle sawing motion, slice galette and serve.\n"

For an accurate measurement of boiling water, bring a kettle of water to a boil and then measure out the desired amount. You can substitute vegetable oil for the lard. Any size shrimp can be used; the larger the shrimp, the more pulses will be required to chop them in step 2. Canned water chestnuts can be substituted for the bamboo shoots. If you don't own a tortilla press, flatten the dough with a 6-inch cake pan or another similar-size, clean, flat surface. Watching our video is helpful when learning how to shape the dumplings. If you don't own a bamboo steamer, here's how to hack one with a plate or platter. Serve with Chili Oil.\n"

Add lard and process until dough forms ball that clears sides of processor bowl, about 1 minute (if dough does not come together, add up to 2 teaspoons hot water, \u00bd teaspoon at a time, processing for 10 seconds between additions, until dough ball forms). Transfer to lightly greased counter and knead for 1 minute. Dough should be slightly tacky. Shape dough into ball, and cover with plastic wrap.\n",

            "To shape, divide dough into 4 equal portions. On lightly greased counter, roll 1 portion of dough into 6-inch rope. Divide rope into 6 equal pieces. Cover all pieces with plastic wrap. Use lightly oiled tortilla press to press 1 piece of dough into 3\u00bc-inch round.\n",
            "Place dough round on fingers of your nondominant hand. Place heaping \u00bd tablespoon of filling in center of dough. To create first pleat, use thumb and index finger of your other hand to pinch dough just above pinky and lift pleat toward top of filling.\n",

Use index finger of pleating hand to position second pleat against first pleat. Repeat pleating motion, rotating dough with each pleat, until all of dough is pleated and dumpling has rounded shape.\n",

Place dumpling pleated side up on counter and cover with plastic wrap. Repeat with remaining dough and filling, lightly oiling tortilla press and counter as needed.\n",
            "To steam, bring 4 cups water to boil in 14-inch flat-bottomed wok or 12-inch skillet. Meanwhile, lightly grease two 8-inch parchment rounds. Place rounds in two 10-inch bamboo steamer baskets. Arrange dumplings on prepared parchment so that they are not touching; stack baskets and cover.

If using a self-basting turkey (such as a frozen Butterball) or a kosher turkey, omit the salt and sugar; instead, apply 4 teaspoons of the herb paste to each breast side and 2 teaspoons to each leg. When removing the foil in step 4, check the drippings in the roasting pan. If they are very dark or there is no liquid, add \u00be cup of water to the pan.

If using a self-basting turkey (such as a frozen Butterball) or a kosher turkey, omit the salt and sugar; instead, apply 4 teaspoons of the herb paste to each breast side and 2 teaspoons to each leg. When removing the foil in step 4, check the drippings in the roasting pan. If they are very dark or there is no liquid, add \u00be cup of water to the pan.

The parbaked rolls are delicate, so don\u2019t handle them until they\u2019re fully frozen. To prevent the rolls from touching as they expand in the oven, use a baking sheet that is at least 18 by 13 inches. This recipe can be easily doubled, but you\u2019ll need enough freezer space for two baking sheets. For the second bake, a toaster oven works well if you\u2019re serving fewer than six rolls.\n"

            "FOR THE DOUGH: In bowl of stand mixer, whisk flour paste and milk until smooth. Add flour, egg, and yeast. Fit mixer with dough hook and mix on low speed until all flour is moistened, 1\u00a0to 2\u00a0minutes. Let stand for 15\u00a0minutes.\n",

            "Transfer dough to lightly floured counter. Knead briefly to form ball and transfer, seam side down, to lightly greased bowl; coat surface of dough lightly with oil spray and cover. Let rise until doubled in volume, about 1\u00a0hour.\n",

Using bench scraper or chef\u2019s knife, cut dough into 16\u00a0equal pieces (4\u00a0rows by 4\u00a0rows). Working with 1\u00a0piece of dough at a time, form dough into smooth, taut balls. (To round, set piece of dough on unfloured counter. Loosely cup your lightly floured hand around dough and, without applying pressure to dough, move your hand in small circular motions. Tackiness of dough against counter and circular motion should work dough into smooth ball.) Arrange dough balls seam side down on prepared sheet, placing 5\u00a0balls down each long side and 6\u00a0down center. Cover and let rise until almost doubled in size, 45\u00a0minutes to 1\u00a0hour.\n",
            "When rolls are almost doubled in size, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 300\u00a0degrees. Bake until rolls are risen and register 170\u00a0to 175\u00a0degrees, 14\u00a0to 16\u00a0minutes (rolls will have little to no color). Transfer sheet to wire rack and let cool completely, 30\u00a0to 45\u00a0minutes (rolls will wrinkle slightly). Transfer sheet to freezer and freeze rolls until solid, 30\u00a0minutes to 1\u00a0hour. Transfer rolls to zipperlock bag and freeze for up to 6\u00a0weeks.\n",
            "TO SERVE: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425\u00a0degrees. Arrange desired number of frozen rolls on parchment-lined baking sheet and bake until deep golden brown, 8\u00a0to 10\u00a0minutes.

If using a self-basting turkey (such as a frozen Butterball) or a kosher turkey, omit the salt and sugar; instead, apply 4 teaspoons of the herb paste to each breast side and 2 teaspoons to each leg. When removing the foil in step 4, check the drippings in the roasting pan. If they are very dark or there is no liquid, add \u00be cup of water to the pan. The success of this recipe is dependent on saturating a baking stone and roasting pan with heat.\u00a0\n"

            "Dipping pretzels in a lye solution before baking gives them their characteristic flavor and texture, but lye is caustic and can be dangerous if used incorrectly. (Lye-dipped pretzels are perfectly safe to eat after baking; the heat of the oven neutralizes the alkali.) If dipping in lye, you must read \u201cHow to Work with Lye Safely\u201d before proceeding. Alternatively, use the baking soda dip. Food-safe lye and pretzel salt are available at specialty baking shops and online. Kosher salt can be substituted for the pretzel salt, but it will melt more easily. We strongly recommend measuring the flour by weight. This is a great place to use a silicone baking mat, or you can line your baking sheet with parchment paper and coat it very generously with vegetable oil spray. Eat the pretzels plain or like the Germans do: sliced horizontally and spread with butter.\n"

            "\u00a0Combine flour, table salt, and yeast in bowl of stand mixer and stir to combine. Add 1 cup room-temperature water and butter. Fit mixer with dough hook and mix on low speed until all flour is moistened, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-low and continue to mix until dough is smooth and elastic, about 6 minutes longer, scraping down bowl and dough hook halfway through mixing. Shape dough into ball and transfer to lightly greased bowl. Cover and let rise until almost doubled in size, about 1 hour.\n",

            "\u00a0Place 1 dough ball seam side up on unfloured counter and flatten with your hand, pressing out as much air as possible. Using rolling pin, roll out dough to expel remaining air. Stretch and pat dough into roughly 4 by 8-inch rectangle with short side parallel to edge of counter. Starting at short side farthest away from you, roll dough into tight cylinder. Pinch seam to seal. Roll cylinder into 9-inch rope and place under damp dish towel. Repeat with remaining dough balls.\n",

Cross rope ends once, and then again. Lift ends and attach them to other side of inverted U at about 10 o\u2019clock and 2 o\u2019clock. Press ends firmly into body of pretzel. Transfer to prepared sheet. Repeat with remaining 9-inch ropes. If pretzels have contracted, stretch each gently and return to sheet. Let sit for 10 minutes, uncovered. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours.\n",

Let pretzel soak for 15 seconds, pressing occasionally to submerge.

            "Dipping pretzel bites in a lye solution before baking gives them their characteristic flavor and texture, but lye is caustic and can be dangerous if used incorrectly. (Lye-dipped pretzel bites are perfectly safe to eat after baking; the heat of the oven neutralizes the alkali.) If dipping in lye, you MUST read the \u201cHow to Work With Lye Safely\u201d before proceeding. Alternatively, use the simmering baking soda dip. Food-safe lye and pretzel salt are available at specialty baking shops and online. Kosher salt may be substituted for the pretzel salt, but it will melt more easily. We strongly recommend measuring the flour by weight. This is a great place to use a silicone baking mat, or you can line your baking sheet with parchment paper and coat it very generously with nonstick spray.\n"

Shape dough into ball and transfer to lightly greased bowl. Cover and let rise until almost doubled, about 1 hour.\n",

Stretch and pat dough into roughly 4 by 8-inch rectangle with short side running parallel to counter edge. Starting at short side farthest away from you, roll dough into tight spiral. Pinch seam to seal. Roll log into 9-inch rope and place under damp cloth. Repeat with remaining dough portions.\n",

Transfer 1 rope to dip and let soak for 15 seconds (it\u2019s fine to curve rope to fit into dip). Drain well and transfer to cutting board, straightening rope if necessary. Repeat dipping remaining ropes. Still wearing gloves, cut ropes into 2-inch lengths and transfer to 2 prepared baking sheets.\n",

            "This recipe is a great way to use leftover mashed potatoes. Mashed potatoes rich in dairy will require less milk than leaner ones; the more milk added, the more batter-like the mixture will be, resulting in softer pancakes. Alternatively, for instructions for making mashed potatoes for this recipe, see \u201cPan Boxty: Best-of-Both-Worlds Potato Cakes.\u201d here. We prefer shredding the potatoes on the large holes of a box grater, but you can also use the large shredding disk of a food processor: Cut the potatoes into 2-inch lengths first so that you are left with short shreds. Caraway seeds add hints of earthiness and citrus but can be omitted if preferred. Serve the pan boxty with fried eggs, smoked salmon, sour cream and chives, or premium salted butter.\n"

Add mixture to saucepan and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to simmer and juice thickens, 30 to 60 seconds. Transfer to bowl and refrigerate until fully cooled, about 1\u00bd hours. Stir in lemon zest.\n",

Add butter to bag and shake to coat with flour mixture. Seal bag, pressing out as much air as possible. Set rolling pin over lowest portion of bag and, using rocking motion, flatten butter beneath pin into large flakes. Working in sections, move pin up bag and flatten remaining butter. Shake bag to mix. Roll over bag with pin, shaking bag occasionally to mix, until flour becomes very pale yellow and almost all of butter is incorporated. Transfer mixture to large bowl (use rubber spatula or bench scraper to scrape any remaining butter and flour mixture from bag). Add ice water and toss with rubber spatula until just combined (mixture will be tacky). Transfer dough to floured counter. With your floured hands, press dough into rough 8-inch square.\n",
            "\u00a0Roll dough into 15 by 10-inch rectangle with short side parallel to edge of counter, flouring counter and dough as needed. Starting at top of dough, fold into thirds like business letter, using bench scraper or metal spatula to release dough from counter. Turn dough 90 degrees and repeat rolling and folding. Divide dough in half crosswise. Wrap each half tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.\n",
            "\u00a0Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 400 degrees. In small bowl, beat egg and remaining pinch salt until well combined. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.\n",
            "\u00a0On lightly floured counter, roll 1 piece of dough into 17 by 9-inch rectangle with short side parallel to edge of counter. Roll dough loosely around rolling pin, turn 90 degrees, and arrange on counter so long side is parallel to edge of counter. If dough has contracted, roll again briefly to achieve 17 by 9-inch dimensions. Using pastry brush, apply 1-inch-wide band of egg wash horizontally across center of dough. Apply 1-inch-wide strip of egg wash to edges of lower half of dough. Apply 1-inch-wide bands of egg wash vertically to divide bottom half of dough into 4 equal squares.\n",
            "\u00a0Place 2 tablespoons filling into each square, being careful to keep filling clear of egg wash. Using spoon, shape filling into rough squares. Using pizza cutter or sharp knife, cut dough at center points between filling to create 4 pieces. Leaving pieces in place but working with 1 piece at a time, gently fold dough over, aligning top edge with bottom edge. Use your fingers to gently press dough layers together, working out as much air as possible. Trim \u00bc inch of dough from ragged and folded sides of each pie. Arrange pies on prepared sheet, leaving at least \u00be inch between them.\n",

Ajwain has an oregano-like flavor and is often added to fried Indian food to aid digestion; if you can't find it, it's OK to leave it out. If preferred, you can substitute \u00bc teaspoon of cayenne pepper for the Thai chile in the stuffing. We strongly recommend weighing the flour for this recipe. Serve the parathas as an entr\u00e9e with raita, prepared mango pickle, or Tamatya-Kandyachi Koshimbir (Tomato-Onion Salad) for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. For more information on amchoor, see this article.\n"

Reduce heat to maintain simmer and cook until potatoes are very tender, about 16 minutes. Drain well and process through ricer or mash with potato masher until completely smooth. Set aside and let partially cool, about 20 minutes.\n",

With processor running, slowly add cold water and process until dough is combined and no dry flour remains, about 30 seconds. Transfer dough to clean counter and knead by hand to form smooth, round ball, about 30 seconds; transfer to bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rest for 30 minutes.\n",

(To round, set piece of dough on unfloured counter. Loosely cup your hand around dough and, without applying pressure to dough, move your hand in small circular motions. Tackiness of dough against counter and circular motion should work dough into smooth ball.) Let dough balls rest, covered, for 15 minutes. While dough balls rest, line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.\n",

Gather edges of dough around stuffing to enclose completely; pinch to seal. Place seam side down on lightly floured counter, gently flatten, and lightly and gently roll to even \u215b-inch-thick round (about 8 inches wide).

Set oven to 350 degrees and heat for 3 minutes (start your timer as soon as you set the dial; oven will not reach 350 degrees). Turn off oven and let incubate for up to 10 more hours, repeating heating step each time oven door is opened. Remove jars from water bath and refrigerate until fully cooled and set, about 8 hours.

            "You'll need a 9-inch metal tart pan with a removable bottom for this recipe. If you don't have pie weights, dried beans or raw rice make great substitutes. The tart shell can be baked up to two days ahead; let it cool, wrap it tightly, and store it at room temperature. This recipe was developed using Endangered Species Smooth + Creamy Milk Chocolate, which has a high cacao content. If you'll be using another brand, consider adding the optional tablespoon of cocoa powder for a darker milk chocolate flavor. Avoid chocolate chips, which sometimes contain additives to hinder melting. If desired, serve with unsweetened whipped cream or fruit.\n"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "FOR THE TART SHELL: Whisk together egg and vanilla in 1-cup liquid measuring cup; set aside. Pulse flour, sugar, and salt in food processor until combined, 2 pulses. Scatter butter over flour mixture; process until mixture looks like very fine crumbs with no pieces of butter visible, about 20 seconds. With processor running, add egg mixture and continue to process until dough just forms mass, about 18 seconds longer.\n",
            "\u00a0Transfer dough to center of 18 by 12-inch piece of parchment paper. Place second sheet of parchment on top of dough and press with your hand to \u00bd-inch thickness. Using rolling pin, roll out dough so it nearly reaches edges of parchment. Using your flat hand on parchment, smooth out wrinkles on both sides. Transfer dough with parchment to baking sheet and freeze until firm, about 30 minutes.\n",
            "\u00a0Place dough and parchment on counter and peel away top layer of parchment. Replace top layer of parchment, flip dough and parchment, and peel away second piece of parchment. Invert 9-inch metal tart ring on left half of dough and press to cut out circle (leave circle on parchment). Using paring knife and ruler, cut right half of dough lengthwise into 1-inch-wide strips. Place removable bottom in tart pan. Lift dough round (if necessary, use thin spatula to loosen) and fit into bottom of tart pan, pressing edges of dough firmly into corners (it's OK if some dough smears up sides of tart pan). Lift strips and fit into sides of pan, overlapping strips only slightly. Trim final strip to fit. (Dough scraps can be sprinkled with sugar and baked as cook's treat.) If at any point dough becomes too soft to manipulate, freeze for 15 minutes.\n",
            "\u00a0Freeze tart shell until very firm, about 20 minutes. While tart shell chills, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees.\n",
            "\u00a0Hold paring knife parallel to counter and shave off any excess dough to force dough into flutes for clean edge. Spray large sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil with vegetable oil spray. Place foil sprayed side down in tart shell and smooth gently along bottom and sides. Fill with pie weights. Bake on rimmed baking sheet until tart shell is golden and set, about 30 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Remove foil and weights and continue to bake tart shell until fully baked and golden brown, about 10 minutes longer. Transfer sheet to wire rack and let cool completely, about 30 minutes.\n",
            "\u00a0FOR THE FILLING:\u00a0Place fine-mesh strainer over medium bowl. Whisk half-and-half; egg yolks; cocoa, if using; and salt in small saucepan until combined. Cook mixture over medium-low heat, stirring constantly and scraping bottom of saucepan with heatproof spatula, until mixture is thickened and silky and registers 170 to 175 degrees, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat. Working quickly, whisk in chocolate and vanilla until smooth. Add melted butter and whisk gently until incorporated. Pour mixture into prepared strainer and transfer strained mixture to cooled tart shell. Let cool completely, about 20 minutes, and then refrigerate until filling is set, at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours.\n",
            "\u00a0Remove outer ring from tart pan. Insert thin metal spatula between crust and pan bottom to loosen tart; slide tart onto serving platter. Cut into wedges and serve. (Leftovers can be wrapped loosely and refrigerated for up to 3 days.)\n"

            "We strongly recommend using a scale to measure the flour. It\u2019s well worth seeking out cardamom seeds at a South Asian market or online. Alternatively, crack open whole green cardamom pods and remove the seeds yourself. Coarsely grind the seeds using a spice grinder or mortar and pestle. Click on the link to \"Shaping Kanelbullar\" below the recipe instructions for step-by-step illustrations. Watching the recipe video is helpful when learning how to shape the buns. Swedish pearl sugar is available online; you can substitute turbinado sugar (sometimes sold as Sugar in the Raw) if you prefer, though it may soften on the buns during storage.\n"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "FOR THE FLOUR PASTE: Whisk milk and flour in small bowl until no lumps remain. Microwave, whisking every 20\u00a0seconds, until mixture has thick, stiff consistency, 1\u00a0to 2\u00a0minutes.\n",
            "FOR THE DOUGH: In bowl of stand mixer, whisk flour paste and milk until smooth. Add flour and yeast. Fit mixer with dough hook and mix on low speed until all flour is moistened, 1\u00a0to 2\u00a0minutes (dough will look quite dry). Let stand for 15\u00a0minutes. Add sugar and salt and mix on medium-low speed for 5\u00a0minutes. Stop mixer and add butter and cardamom. Continue to mix on medium-low speed 5\u00a0minutes longer, scraping down dough hook and sides of bowl halfway through mixing (dough may stick to bottom of bowl but should clear sides).\n",
            "Lightly grease 13\u00a0by 9-inch baking pan. Transfer dough to prepared pan (scrape bowl but do not wash). Flip dough, then press and stretch dough until it reaches edges of pan. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1\u00a0hour. While dough chills, make\u00a0filling.\n",
            "FOR THE FILLING: Add all ingredients to now-empty mixer bowl. Fit mixer with paddle and mix on low speed until fully combined, about 1\u00a0minute.\n",
            "Line 18 by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Transfer dough to well\u2011floured counter. Roll dough into 18 by 10-inch rectangle, with shorter side parallel to edge of counter. Using offset spatula, spread filling over lower two\u2011thirds\u00a0of rectangle, going all the way to edges (if filling is too stiff to spread, transfer to smaller bowl and microwave for 5\u00a0to 10\u00a0seconds). Fold upper third of dough over middle third. Fold lower third over middle third to create 6 by 10-inch rectangle. Roll into 12-inch square.\n",
            "Cut dough into twelve\u00a01-inch strips. Following photos in \"Shaping Kanelbullar,\" below, cut each strip in half lengthwise, leaving it attached at very top (each strip will look like a pair of legs) (A). Extend 1 strip to 24-inch length, but do not stretch (B). Starting at 1 end, wrap strip around tips of your first 3 fingers (C), loosely coiling strands side by side along length of your fingers (D). Continue to wrap loosely until you have just 4\u00a0to 6\u00a0inches left (E). Use your thumb to pin dough to side of bundle closest to you, then loop remaining strip over bundle (F). Transfer to prepared sheet, tucking end of strip under bun (G). Repeat with remaining strips. Cover sheet with plastic or damp dish towel. Let sit until slightly puffed, about 1\u00a0hour.\n",
            "TO BAKE: About 15\u00a0minutes before baking, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425\u00a0degrees. Brush buns with egg mixture (you won\u2019t need all of it) and sprinkle 1\u00a0teaspoon pearl sugar on top of each bun. Bake until buns are golden brown and register at least 200\u00a0degrees, 13\u00a0to 17\u00a0minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Transfer buns, still on sheet, to wire rack and let sit for 5\u00a0minutes. Use spatula to transfer buns to wire rack (some filling may leak out and form crisp frill around bun). Let cool for at least 10\u00a0minutes before serving. (Buns can be cooled completely and stored in zipper-lock bag at room temperature for up to 2\u00a0days or frozen for up to 2\u00a0weeks.)\n"

Inexpensive sake is fine here; it can often be purchased in small cans. We strain the glaze in step 4 to improve its clarity, but you can skip this process if you prefer.

            "We strongly recommend weighing the flour for this recipe. The butter block should be cool but malleable at the beginning of step 4; if your kitchen is cooler than 70 degrees, you may need to leave the butter block on the counter for up to 20 minutes (it's OK to leave the dough in the freezer for the extended time). Once you begin rolling and folding the dough, you'll want to move swiftly and without interruption, so have your ingredients and equipment in place before you start. Keeping plenty of flour under the dough while rolling will help prevent the layers from tearing; brushing away excess flour on top of the dough before folding will help the dough adhere to itself.\n"

Attach dough hook and knead on low speed until cohesive dough forms, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-low and knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Shape dough into ball (scrape out mixer bowl but do not wash). Flatten into rough 5-inch square and transfer to lightly greased plate. Cover dough and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours. While dough rests, make butter packet.\n",

Open parchment packet and set aside. Combine butter, \u00be cup sugar, and remaining \u00bd teaspoon salt in now-empty mixer bowl. Using paddle, mix on low speed until thoroughly combined, about 1 minute. Transfer butter mixture to prepared parchment rectangle, fold parchment over mixture, and press to \u00bd-inch thickness. Refold parchment at creases to enclose mixture. Turn packet over so flaps are underneath and roll gently until butter mixture fills packet, taking care to achieve even thickness. Refrigerate for at least 45 minutes or up to 24 hours.\n",

Fold upper and lower sections of dough over butter so they meet in center (it's OK to gently stretch dough). Press center seam and side seams closed. Dust counter with more flour if necessary. Place rolling pin at top edge of dough and press gently to make slight depression across top. Lift pin, move it 1 inch closer to you, and press again. Continue pressing and lifting to bottom edge. Turn rolling pin 90 degrees and make similar depressions across width of dough. Roll dough out lengthwise into 21 by 7-inch rectangle (it's OK if it becomes slightly wider). Pop any bubbles that form. Using dry pastry brush, dust off any flour clinging to surface of dough. Starting at bottom of dough, fold into thirds like business letter to form 7-inch square. Turn square 90 degrees. Dust counter with more flour if necessary. Roll out lengthwise into 21 by 7-inch rectangle, and pop any bubbles. Using dry pastry brush, dust off any flour clinging to surface of dough, and fold into thirds.\n",

Push right and left corners toward center, and then push top and bottom corners toward center to form rough, crumpled round. Press top to compress. Flip dough so smoother side is facing up, then tuck edges under to form round. Flatten gently with your hands, then roll dough into 9\u00bd-inch round. Transfer to prepared pan (it's OK if dough is slightly sticky), squishing edges to fit.\n",
            "Brush top with milk. Using sharp paring knife, score top of pastry in diamond pattern. Sprinkle evenly with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar. Using paring knife, pierce dough all the way down to pan surface in 4 places to create air vents. Bake until pastry is deeply browned and crisp, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Let cool in pan on wire rack for 10 minutes. Invert, remove parchment, and reinvert. Let cool for at least 30 minutes before serving.

            "This recipe can be halved, if desired; if halving, use an 8-inch glass baking dish. You can use fresh or thawed frozen blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, hulled strawberries, or a combination of berries. If using fresh strawberries, weigh them after hulling. If using any type of thawed berries, do not drain them before adding them to the blender. We think this granita stands well on its own, but if you'd like to add some complexity, you can add 2 to 3 tablespoons of chopped fresh mint, 1 to 2 teaspoons of grated fresh ginger, or 1 to 2 teaspoons of grated lemon zest (do not add more than one of these) to the blender in step 1. Serve this granita on its own or garnish it with unsweetened whipped cream (layer it to make a parfait, if desired), fresh berries, or a splash of prosecco or your favorite liqueur.\n"

            "Because sausage requires a precise ratio of salt to trimmed meat, you'll need a scale that measures in grams, and you'll need to do some simple math. This recipe requires at least 8 hours of salting. Because you'll be measuring the salt by weight instead of volume, you can use either table salt or kosher salt. Pork butt roast is often labeled Boston butt. For the best texture, buy a well-marbled roast that has a defined fat cap. We like the flavor of the sausage made with both whole and ground fennel, but you don't have to buy both forms; simply use a spice grinder or mortar and pestle to finely grind the whole seeds. This recipe can easily be halved or doubled and freezes well.\n"

Multiply weight of pork by 0.015 to determine salt amount (round to nearest gram). Weigh out salt.\n",

            "FOR A GRINDER:\u00a0Place meat grinder attachments, including coarse die (3/16 or \u00bc inch), in freezer for at least 1 hour before using. Set medium bowl in large bowl filled with ice. Grind pork at medium speed into prepared medium bowl.\n",
            "FOR A FOOD PROCESSOR:\u00a0Place one-quarter of pork in food processor and pulse until finely ground into \u215b- to 1/16-inch pieces, 14 to 16 pulses, stopping to redistribute pork around bowl as necessary to ensure meat is evenly ground. Transfer ground pork to large bowl. Repeat with remaining 3 batches of pork.\n",

The recipe can be halved, using a 2-pound center-cut fillet and half as much sugar and salt in the cure; the cooking time will be roughly the same as with a full side of salmon. We offer a wide time range for drying the salmon; choose what works best for your schedule. We prefer hickory chips for our salmon, but any kind of hardwood chips will work. Try the salmon on its own, in our Hot-Smoked Salmon Kedgeree, flaked over a salad, mixed into a quiche filling, or stirred into just-set scrambled eggs.\n"

If desired, this recipe can be made over two days: Make the pastry cream and craquelin on day 1 and the puffs on day 2. We strongly recommend measuring the flour by weight. We prefer whole milk in the pastry cream, but you can use low-fat milk; do not use skim milk. Use a mixer to whip the cream if you prefer. To create festive colored buns, substitute granulated sugar for the brown sugar in the craquelin. Add gel or paste food coloring to the dough until the desired color is achieved.\n"

            "FOR THE PASTRY CREAM:\u00a0Heat 2 cups milk in medium saucepan over medium heat until just simmering. Meanwhile, whisk flour, sugar, and salt in medium bowl until combined. Add egg yolks and remaining \u00bd cup milk to flour mixture and whisk until smooth. Remove saucepan from heat and, whisking constantly, slowly add \u00bd cup warm milk to yolk mixture to temper. Whisking constantly, add tempered yolk mixture to milk in saucepan.\n",
            "\u00a0Return saucepan to medium heat and cook, whisking constantly, until mixture thickens slightly, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to simmer, whisking constantly, for 8 minutes. Increase heat to medium and cook, whisking vigorously, until very thick (mixture dripped from whisk should mound on surface), 1 to 2 minutes. Off heat, whisk in butter and vanilla until butter is melted and incorporated. Transfer to wide bowl. Press lightly greased parchment paper directly on surface and refrigerate until set, at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours.\n",
            "\u00a0FOR THE CRAQUELIN:\u00a0Mix butter and sugar in medium bowl until combined. Mix in flour and salt. Add gel or paste food coloring to craquelin dough until desired color is achieved. Transfer mixture to large sheet of parchment and press into 6-inch square. Cover with second piece of parchment and roll dough into 13 by 9-inch rectangle (it's fine to trim and patch dough to achieve correct dimensions). Remove top piece of parchment and use 2-inch round cutter to cut 24 circles. Leaving circles and trim in place, replace top parchment and transfer to rimless baking sheet. Freeze until firm, at least 30 minutes or up to 2 days.\n",
            "\u00a0FOR THE CHOUX:\u00a0Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Spray rimmed baking sheet with vegetable oil spray and dust lightly and evenly with flour, discarding any excess. Using 2-inch round cutter, mark 24 circles on sheet. Fit pastry bag with \u00bd-inch round tip. Beat eggs and white together in 2-cup liquid measuring cup.\n",
            "\u00a0Bring water, butter, milk, sugar, and salt to boil in small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Off heat, stir in flour until incorporated. Return saucepan to low heat and cook, stirring constantly and using smearing motion, until mixture looks like shiny, wet sand, about 3 minutes (mixture should register between 175 and 180 degrees).\n",
            "\u00a0Immediately transfer hot mixture to food processor and process for 10 seconds to cool slightly. With processor running, add beaten eggs in steady stream and process until incorporated, about 30 seconds. Scrape down sides of bowl and continue to process until smooth, thick, sticky paste forms, about 30 seconds longer.\n",
            "\u00a0Fill pastry bag with warm mixture and pipe into 1\u00bd-inch-wide mounds on prepared sheet, using circles as guide. Using small, thin spatula, transfer 1 frozen craquelin disk to top of each mound. Bake for 15 minutes; then, without opening oven door, reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees and continue to bake until golden brown and firm, 7 to 10 minutes longer.\n",
            "\u00a0Remove sheet from oven and cut \u00be-inch slit into side of each pastry with paring knife to release steam. Return pastries to oven, turn off oven, and prop open oven door with handle of wooden spoon. Let pastries dry until center is mostly dry and surface is crisp, about 45 minutes. Transfer pastries to wire rack and let cool completely.\n",
            "\u00a0TO SERVE: Fit pastry bag with \u00bc-inch round tip. In large bowl, whisk cream to stiff peaks. Gently whisk pastry cream until smooth. Fold pastry cream into whipped cream until combined. Transfer one-third of mixture to pastry bag. To fill choux buns, insert pastry tip \u00be inch into opening and squeeze gently until cream just starts to appear around opening, about 2 tablespoons cream per bun. Refill bag as needed. Serve. (Choux are best eaten up to 2 hours after filling. Leftovers can be refrigerated for up to 3 days but will soften over time.)\n"

Using your hands, carefully break paste into 2-inch chunks and redistribute evenly around processor blade. Add remaining 1 cup flour and pulse until mixture is broken into pieces no larger than 1 inch (most pieces will be much smaller), 4 to 5 pulses. Transfer mixture to medium bowl. Add shredded butter and toss until butter pieces are separated and coated with flour.\n",

Press dough with spatula until dough sticks together. Use spatula to divide dough into 2 portions. Transfer each portion to sheet of plastic wrap. Working with 1 portion at a time, draw edges of plastic over dough and press firmly on sides and top to form compact, fissure-free mass; wrap in plastic and form into 5-inch disk. Refrigerate dough for at least 2 hours or up to 2 days. Let chilled dough sit on counter until softened slightly, about 10 minutes, before rolling. (Wrapped dough can be frozen for up to 1 month. If frozen, let dough thaw completely on counter before rolling.)\n",

Add potatoes and baking soda. Return to boil and cook for 1 minute. Drain potatoes. Return potatoes to pot; add cream, garlic, pepper, nutmeg, and onion and any accumulated liquid; and bring to simmer over high heat. Adjust heat to maintain simmer and cook, stirring gently and frequently (it's OK if some slices break), until cream thickens and begins to coat potatoes, about 5 minutes. Let cool off heat for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.\n",
            "\u00a0Roll 1 disk of dough into 12-inch round on well-floured counter. Loosely roll dough around rolling pin and gently unroll onto 9-inch pie plate, letting excess dough hang over edge. Ease dough into plate by gently lifting edge of dough with your hand while pressing into plate bottom with your other hand. Refrigerate until dough is firm, about 30 minutes. Roll second disk of dough into 12-inch round on well-floured counter, then transfer to parchment paper\u2013lined baking sheet; refrigerate for 30 minutes. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees.\n",

Using paring knife or round cutter, cut \u00bd-inch hole in center of second dough round. Loosely roll dough round around rolling pin and gently unroll it over filling, aligning hole with center of pie and leaving at least \u00bd-inch overhang all around. Fold dough under itself so edge of fold is flush with outer rim of pie plate. Flute edges using your thumb and forefinger or press with tines of fork to seal. Place pie on parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and brush with egg. Bake until top is light golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes.\n",

If pie begins to get too brown before potatoes are softened, cover loosely with aluminum foil. Let pie cool on wire rack for at least 30 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.\n"

            "Milk and cream are subjected to heat treatment to kill the bacteria that would otherwise thrive in their nutrient-rich environments. According to the International Dairy Foods Association, cream labeled \u201cpasteurized\u201d is generally heated and held at 161\u00b0F for 15 seconds. Increasingly common is a method called ultrapasteurization, in which the cream is held at 275\u00b0F or higher for just 1 or 2 seconds. This results in a longer shelf life, but in our experience the butter it makes is not quite as flavorful as butter made with regular pasteurized cream, possibly because the culturing bacteria find ultrapasteurized cream a less hospitable place to work their charms.\u00a0The ideal temperature range for churning butter is 55 to 60 degrees F/10 to 15.5 degrees C. At colder temperatures, the fat is too firm, and the thick cream just sticks to the sides of the food processor bowl instead of churning with the blades. At warmer temperatures, too much of the fat is liquid instead of crystallized, which results in a greasier final product.\u00a0In step 2, you can chill the cream in the refrigerator or over an ice bath. You can also refrigerate the cultured cream for several days if that's convenient; just be sure to cover it tightly to keep odors out. When you're ready to turn it into butter, take the mixture out of the refrigerator and, if necessary, let it warm to 55 to 60 degrees F/10 to 15.5 degrees C.Cream aged for one day will make a sweetish butter with just a hint of tang. As the aging process continues\u2014especially at warmer room temperatures\u2014the cream gets more and more pungent. After a week it may smell almost too strong for some tastes, but most of what you smell resides in the liquid portion that gets separated out, leaving the butter surprisingly mellow. Homemade\u00a0cultured butter also makes incredible browned butter. Try it on your next pasta dish.\n"

            "Combine cream and buttermilk in clean lidded container. Cover container or close carton and let sit at room temperature until mixture smells tangy and buttery and has a thick consistency, at least 24 hours or\u2014our recommendation\u2014up to 1 week in cooler seasons, checking daily.\n",

            "Transfer cream to food processor and process until mixture turns from grainy whipped cream to lumps of butter splashing in liquid, 1 to 3 minutes. Stop processor immediately.\n",
            "Fill medium bowl halfway with ice and water. Line fine-mesh strainer with triple layer of cheesecloth, leaving few inches of cloth hanging over sides of strainer. Pour butter mixture through cheesecloth-lined strainer into large bowl (buttermilk will collect in bowl). Lift cheesecloth by edges and twist and squeeze tightly over strainer to press out more buttermilk (when butter starts to squeeze through cheesecloth, you are done). Transfer cheesecloth-wrapped butter to ice bath until firm around exterior, about 2 minutes. Transfer buttermilk to airtight container; do not wash bowl.\n",
            "Remove butter from cheesecloth and transfer to now-empty bowl. Stir and press with wooden spoon (a metal utensil will conduct heat from your hands and make the butter soft) to force out additional buttermilk from butter, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain this buttermilk from bowl, add to buttermilk container, and refrigerate until ready to use. If making salted butter, knead salt into butter with wooden spoon. Transfer butter to separate airtight container and refrigerate until ready to use. (Butter can be refrigerated for up to 2 months.)\n"

If you choose Muir Glen Diced Tomatoes instead, use the can's entire contents, without discarding any liquid. The pasta and sauce quantities can be doubled, but you will have to simmer the sauce for an extra five or six minutes to thicken it. Note that the salt in this recipe is added in two batches; if you are using the sauce for something other than pasta, simply salt to taste rather than adding the second quantity of salt. Although 3/4 of a pound of pasta may seem an odd quantity, a full pound of pasta will dilute the sauce, resulting in a lack of flavor.\n"

In step 2, if the skin is dark golden brown but the breast has not yet reached 155 degrees, cover the chicken with foil and continue to broil.

            "You'll need a blender for this recipe. To make a puree with the smoothest texture, you'll need a potato ricer or food mill equipped with a fine disk; if these aren't available, you can mash the potato thoroughly with a potato masher, but the dip will have a more rustic texture. We prefer a russet potato for its earthier flavor, but a Yukon Gold works well, too. If a single large potato is unavailable, it's fine to use two smaller potatoes that total 12 ounces. You can use either blanched or skin-on almonds. A rasp-style grater makes quick work of turning the garlic into a paste. Serve as a dip with crudit\u00e9s, spread on crackers or bread, or as an accompaniment to fish or meat.\n"
