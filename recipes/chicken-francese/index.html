    <li>1 large lemon </li>
   
    <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter,  divided</li>
   
    <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour, divided</li>
   
    <li>3  large eggs </li>
   
    <li>2 tablespoons water </li>
   
    <li>⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil for frying</li>
   
    <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
   
    <li>1  garlic clove, minced</li>
   
    <li>⅓ cup dry white wine </li>
   
    <li>1½ cups chicken broth </li>
   
    <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley </li>
   
</ul>

<h3>Equipment</h3>
<ul>
    
    <li>Chef’s Knives for $75 or Less</li>
   
    <li>Rasp-Style Graters</li>
   
    <li>Rimmed Baking Sheets</li>
   
    <li>12-Inch Stainless-Steel Skillets</li>
   
</ul>

<h3>Recipe Notes</h3>
<ol>
    
    <li>Use a stainless-steel skillet, not cast iron, the seasoning of which can be damaged by the acidic sauce. To ensure that the sauce develops the correct flavor and consistency, transfer the liquid to a heatproof liquid measuring cup once or twice during simmering to monitor the amount. Serve the cutlets with buttered pasta, white rice, potatoes, or crusty bread and a simple steamed vegetable.
</li>
   
</ol>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
    
    <li> Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Cut each chicken breast in half crosswise, then cut thick half in half again horizontally, creating 3 cutlets of similar thickness. Place cutlets between sheets of plastic wrap and gently pound to even ¼-inch thickness. Place cutlets in bowl and toss with salt and pepper. Set aside for 15 minutes.
</li>
   
    <li> Grate peel from 1 end of lemon to yield 1 teaspoon zest. Cut lemon in half crosswise and juice zested lemon half. Measure out 2 tablespoons juice. Slice remaining (unzested) lemon half into four ¼-inch-thick rounds. Discard end. Cut 3 tablespoons butter into ½-inch cubes and transfer to small bowl. Sprinkle cubes with 1 teaspoon flour and toss until cubes are fully coated and no loose flour remains in bowl; refrigerate until needed.
</li>
   
    <li> Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet. Spread remaining flour in shallow dish. In medium bowl, whisk eggs with water. Working with 1 cutlet at a time, dredge cutlets in flour, shaking gently to remove excess. Transfer to prepared rack.
</li>
   
    <li> Heat olive oil and vegetable oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working with 1 cutlet at a time, coat 4 cutlets with egg mixture and gently place in skillet. Reduce heat to medium and cook until golden brown on 1 side, about 2 minutes. Using tongs, flip and cook until golden brown on second side, about 2 minutes. Arrange cutlets on serving platter and place in oven. Repeat with remaining cutlets in 2 batches.
</li>
   
    <li> Discard oil. Gently wipe out skillet with paper towels. Return skillet to medium heat and add lemon slices and remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Cook, flipping slices occasionally, until lightly browned on both sides, about 3 minutes. Transfer lemon slices to cutting board.
</li>
   
    <li> Add garlic to now-empty skillet and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in wine, scraping up any browned bits, and increase heat to medium-high. Bring to rapid simmer and cook until wine is mostly evaporated, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in broth and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until liquid is reduced to ⅔ cup, 6 to 8 minutes longer.
</li>
   
    <li> Reduce heat to low and stir in reserved lemon zest and juice. Whisk in floured butter cubes, a few at a time, until sauce is thickened to consistency of heavy cream, 1½ to 2 minutes. Off heat, stir in parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Cut browned lemon slices in half and scatter over cutlets. Spoon sauce over cutlets and serve.
</li>
   
</ol>
