 <p>1½ hours, plus 8 hours curing and drying</p>
 -->

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    
    <li>½ cup sugar for curing</li>
   
    <li>½ cup kosher salt for curing</li>
   
    <li>1 (4-pound) skin-on side of salmon,  thin end of tail removed and reserved for another use, pin bones removed, and belly fat trimmed</li>
   
    <li>1 - 1½  cups wood chips </li>
   
</ul>

<h3>Equipment</h3>
<ul>
    
    <li>Rimmed Baking Sheets</li>
   
    <li>Wire Racks</li>
   
    <li>Gas Grills Under $500</li>
   
    <li>Chimney Starters</li>
   
</ul>

<h3>Recipe Notes</h3>
<ol>
    
    <li>We used Diamond Crystal kosher salt here. If using Morton kosher salt, which is denser, use only 6 tablespoons. We developed this recipe with farmed salmon. If you would like to use wild fish, we recommend king salmon; cook it to 120 degrees. The recipe can be halved, using a 2-pound center-cut fillet and half as much sugar and salt in the cure; the cooking time will be roughly the same as with a full side of salmon. We offer a wide time range for drying the salmon; choose what works best for your schedule. We prefer hickory chips for our salmon, but any kind of hardwood chips will work. Try the salmon on its own, in our Hot-Smoked Salmon Kedgeree, flaked over a salad, mixed into a quiche filling, or stirred into just-set scrambled eggs.

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
    
    <li> Combine sugar and salt in small bowl. Place salmon on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Spread sugar mixture evenly over surface of flesh, pressing gently to adhere. Refrigerate, uncovered, for 4 hours.
</li>
   
    <li> Rinse salmon under cold water and return to rack. Pat dry with paper towels. Refrigerate, uncovered, until surface of fillet is tacky and matte, 4 to 20 hours.
</li>
   
    <li> Using large piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil, wrap chips (1 cup if using charcoal; 1½ cups if using gas) in 8 by 4½-inch foil packet. (Make sure chips do not poke holes in sides or bottom of packet. If using gas, make sure there are no more than 2 layers of foil on bottom of packet.) Cut 3 evenly spaced 2-inch slits in top of packet.
</li>
   
    <li>FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent halfway. Light large chimney starter half filled with charcoal briquettes (3 quarts). Place 6 unlit briquettes on 1 side of grill. When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour into steeply banked pile over unlit briquettes. Place wood chip packet on coals with slits facing up. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent halfway. Heat grill until hot and wood chips are smoking, about 5 minutes.
</li>
   
    <li>FOR A GAS GRILL: Remove cooking grate and place wood chip packet directly on primary burner. Set grate in place; turn primary burner to high (leave other burners off); cover; and heat grill until hot and wood chips are smoking, 15 to 25 minutes. Turn primary burner to medium. (Adjust primary burner as needed to maintain grill temperature between 275 and 300 degrees.)
</li>
   
    <li> Clean and oil cooking grate. Fold large piece of heavy-duty foil into 18 by 6-inch rectangle. Spray lightly with vegetable oil spray. Place foil rectangle on cooler side of grill (on gas grill arrange foil parallel to primary burner, spaced 8 to 10 inches from heat source) and place salmon on foil. Cover grill (positioning lid vent over salmon if using charcoal) and cook until center of thickest part of fillet registers 125 degrees and is still translucent when cut into with paring knife, 50 minutes to 1 hour 10 minutes.
</li>
   
    <li> Using foil as sling, transfer salmon to platter. Carefully slide foil out from beneath salmon. Serve. (Salmon can be cut into pieces, cooled completely, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, and frozen for up to 2 months.)
