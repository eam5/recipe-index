 <p>Makes about 2 pounds sausage</p>

 <p>1 hour, plus 8 hours salting</p>
 -->

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    
    <li>4 teaspoons fennel seeds </li>
   
    <li>2 teaspoons sugar </li>
   
    <li>2 teaspoons paprika </li>
   
    <li>1 teaspoon pepper </li>
   
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground fennel </li>
   
    <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder </li>
   
    <li>2 pounds boneless pork butt roast with at least ¼-inch-thick fat cap</li>
   
    <li>  Salt </li>
   
</ul>

<h3>Equipment</h3>
<ul>
    
    <li>Rimmed Baking Sheets</li>
   
    <li>Measuring Spoons</li>
   
</ul>

<h3>Recipe Notes</h3>
<ol>
    
    <li>Because sausage requires a precise ratio of salt to trimmed meat, you'll need a scale that measures in grams, and you'll need to do some simple math. This recipe requires at least 8 hours of salting. Because you'll be measuring the salt by weight instead of volume, you can use either table salt or kosher salt. Pork butt roast is often labeled Boston butt. For the best texture, buy a well-marbled roast that has a defined fat cap. We like the flavor of the sausage made with both whole and ground fennel, but you don't have to buy both forms; simply use a spice grinder or mortar and pestle to finely grind the whole seeds. This recipe can easily be halved or doubled and freezes well.
</li>
   
</ol>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
    
    <li> Mix fennel seeds, sugar, paprika, pepper, ground fennel, and garlic powder in small bowl and set aside. Leaving fat cap intact, cut pork into ¾-inch pieces, trimming and discarding all sinew and connective tissue. Weigh trimmed pork and note weight in grams. Multiply weight of pork by 0.015 to determine salt amount (round to nearest gram). Weigh out salt.
</li>
   
    <li> Toss pork, salt, and fennel seed mixture in bowl until well combined. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or up to 2 days.
</li>
   
    <li> Transfer pork to rimmed baking sheet and spread in single layer, leaving space around each chunk. Freeze until pork is very firm and starting to harden around edges but still pliable, 35 to 55 minutes.
</li>
   
    <li>FOR A GRINDER: Place meat grinder attachments, including coarse die (3/16 or ¼ inch), in freezer for at least 1 hour before using. Set medium bowl in large bowl filled with ice. Grind pork at medium speed into prepared medium bowl.
</li>
   
    <li>FOR A FOOD PROCESSOR: Place one-quarter of pork in food processor and pulse until finely ground into ⅛- to 1/16-inch pieces, 14 to 16 pulses, stopping to redistribute pork around bowl as necessary to ensure meat is evenly ground. Transfer ground pork to large bowl. Repeat with remaining 3 batches of pork.
</li>
   
    <li> Inspect ground pork carefully, discarding any strands of gristle or silverskin. Using your hands or stiff rubber spatula, knead pork vigorously, smearing against sides and bottom of bowl, until pork begins to tighten, feels tacky, and sticks to bottom of bowl and palm of your hand, 1½ to 2 minutes. Use immediately or wrap bowl tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 24 hours (or transfer sausage to zipper-lock bag and freeze for up to 1 month).
</li>
