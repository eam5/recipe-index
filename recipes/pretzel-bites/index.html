<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    
    <li>2⅓ cups (12¾ ounces) bread flour </li>
   
    <li>1 teaspoon table salt </li>
   
    <li>1 teaspoon instant or rapid-rise yeast </li>
   
    <li>1 cup room temperature water </li>
   
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened </li>
   
    <li>40g  lye crystals or ½ cup baking soda</li>
   
    <li>  Pretzel salt </li>
   
</ul>

<h3>Equipment</h3>
<ul>
    
    <li>Digital Kitchen Scales</li>
   
    <li>Wire Racks</li>
   
    <li>Inexpensive Stand Mixers</li>
   
    <li>Rimmed Baking Sheets</li>
   
</ul>

<h3>Recipe Notes</h3>
<ol>
    
    <li>Dipping pretzel bites in a lye solution before baking gives them their characteristic flavor and texture, but lye is caustic and can be dangerous if used incorrectly. (Lye-dipped pretzel bites are perfectly safe to eat after baking; the heat of the oven neutralizes the alkali.) If dipping in lye, you MUST read the “How to Work With Lye Safely” before proceeding. Alternatively, use the simmering baking soda dip. Food-safe lye and pretzel salt are available at specialty baking shops and online. Kosher salt may be substituted for the pretzel salt, but it will melt more easily. We strongly recommend measuring the flour by weight. This is a great place to use a silicone baking mat, or you can line your baking sheet with parchment paper and coat it very generously with nonstick spray.

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
    
    <li>Combine flour, salt, and yeast in bowl of stand mixer and stir to combine. Add water and butter. Attach dough hook and mix on low speed until all flour is moistened, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-low and continue to mix until dough is smooth and elastic, about 6 minutes, scraping down bowl and dough hook halfway through mixing. Shape dough into ball and transfer to lightly greased bowl. Cover and let rise until almost doubled, about 1 hour.
</li>
   
    <li>Divide dough into 8 equal portions. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, form into smooth balls. Cover with damp towel and let rest 10 minutes. While dough rests, line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
</li>
   
    <li>Place 1 dough ball seam side up on un-floured surface and flatten with hand, pressing out as much air as possible. Using rolling pin, roll dough out to expel remaining air. Stretch and pat dough into roughly 4 by 8-inch rectangle with short side running parallel to counter edge. Starting at short side farthest away from you, roll dough into tight spiral. Pinch seam to seal. Roll log into 9-inch rope and place under damp cloth. Repeat with remaining dough portions.
</li>
   
    <li>Roll first 9-inch rope into 12-inch rope. Transfer to prepared baking sheet, laying rope crosswise. Repeat with remaining logs. Let sit for 10 minutes, uncovered. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 24 hours.
</li>
   
    <li>Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 475 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with silicone mats or well-greased parchment.
</li>
   
    <li>FOR THE LYE DIP: Set up station as directed in step 2 of “Working with Lye Safely.” Set plastic cutting board next to dip. Transfer 1 rope to dip and let soak for 15 seconds (it’s fine to curve rope to fit into dip). Drain well and transfer to cutting board, straightening rope if necessary. Repeat dipping remaining ropes. Still wearing gloves, cut ropes into 2-inch lengths and transfer to 2 prepared baking sheets.
</li>
   
    <li>FOR THE BAKING SODA DIP: Dissolve baking soda in 8 cups water in Dutch oven and bring to boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to simmer. Set plastic cutting board next to dip. Transfer 1 rope to simmering baking soda mixture and cook for 30 seconds, pressing occasionally with slotted spatula to submerge. Drain rope well and transfer to cutting board, straightening rope if necessary. Repeat simmering remaining ropes. Cut ropes into 2-inch lengths and transfer to 2 prepared baking sheets.
</li>
   
    <li>Sprinkle pretzels evenly with salt. Bake until deeply browned, about 8 to 10 minutes, switching and rotating pans halfway through baking. Transfer to wire rack and cool at least 5 minutes before serving.
</li>
